# Week 05 Journal

### Are there particular interactions you're interested in?

I am interested in exploring new forms of interactions in physical computing, especially air gestures and Haptic Feedbacks. I think we need newer interactions to interact with virtual world. Some of the newer interactions like interactions via Gestures like Myo Gesture Band, 3D Depth sensing using Microsoft Kinect, Air Gestures using Project Soli.

### Are there particular contexts that you want to engage with?

Some particular contexts I would like to engage myself is building to empower and educate people through technology. Apart from this I would love to play around with theatre lighting and art installations involving physical computing in some form. Particularly, machine learning and physical computing would be great to explore and experiment around.

### What kind of research have you already been doing?

Currently, I am researching on how can I enable vision impaired people to access and navigate public places and buildings independently. Last week I visited Lighthouse Guild located at Upper East Side in Manhattan and had conversations with a few vision impaired people there. I have a few interesting conversations to share

>I can only tell the difference between light and dark and nothing else. I have seen a transition from being an independent working man to now a dependent man. I am dependent on my caregiver for navigating me around a new space. I use a cane to move around, and many times my cane touches someone’s body, and it feels weird.

>I am in the initial stage of vision loss. I love reading books, and it has become very hard to read now. Here (at Lighthouse Guild) I am learning to use assistive tools and technology to help me read, cook, and do my other daily tasks. I am learning to use screen readers and other adaptive technology for helping me through.

>I have to carry my cane everywhere to check for obstacles and people around me, though I get a sense when someone is around, it is hard to sense other obstacles. Over time I have developed a powerful smell sensation, and it helps me to navigate in a known space. Walking down to a new place is still troublesome.

>I have Peter’s Anomaly. I can see roughly a foot in front of me. Technology has helped me do a number of tasks in my daily life which would be difficult to do on my own. I use “Siri” to do my daily tasks such as keeping note of things, managing my emails, calling my family and friends, a voiceover to navigate my phone, setting alarms, even checking my twitter and a bunch of stuff. I love talking to Siri now. I come here almost every day to learn Braille.

It made me feel amazing to see how they see their world, how they’ve adapted themselves. I felt that many of them feel dependent on someone else. Also, navigation is an issue that needs to be researched and solved for people with vision impairments. Not every place in the city is capable of letting people with vision impairments navigate independently. Technology can play a more prominent role in allowing them to live a more independent life, and we, as a society, need to make them feel more inclusive.

### Is there something in your personal experience that you want to bring to future physical computing projects?

In past I have worked on various projects ranging from electronic instruments (electronic component testers) to theatre and stage synchronized lighting. Of all I love playing around with LEDs and working with them on all sorts of projects. In future projects I would love to explore Human Interactions around colors and sound. Also, embedding haptic feedbacks in the overall experience.
